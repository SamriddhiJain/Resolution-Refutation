This project implements the following strategies for the resolution refutation:
1. Simple Brute Force (extensive matching)
2. Set of Support Strategy
3. Input Strategy
4. Unit Resolution

The project takes the input knowledge base as a Rule ML file and applies the strategy asked by user, and visualises the new resolvents in the form of a graph.
The project also supports query answer predicates and can be used for building a domain dependent query bot.

Before running the project, you will need these,
1. http://www.jdom.org/downloads/, for the XML Rule-ML like format for KB.
2. http://graphstream-project.org/download/, for visualising the resolvents.
